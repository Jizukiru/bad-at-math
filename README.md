    This README serves a list of the programs in the repo and a short description of them. They are not, by default, meant to work/communicate with other programs in the repo. Kinks and intricacies caused by, frankly, lack of skill will also be listed here.

    Polynomials.py: Old Python program initially meant to solve quadratic equations; now also able to do polynomial factorization of polynomials of the n-th degree if provided with a root.
    My programming proved insufficient to deal with non-integer factors of x when solving quadratics. Thus the program forces integer values using a try-except block and recursively calling the calculator function. The calculator also only produces results in the Real domain.
    QuadraticSolver.cpp: c++ code that solves a quadratic equation using runtime arguments as the terms of the polynomial. Note that this program *exlcusively* uses arguments inputted from the CLI. Any number of arguments that is not 3 (the terms of the polynomial) will not result in a calculation.
    Any type of arguments is converted to an integer. Equations where a = 0 will not be calculated (too bored to implement). Non-Real solutions are also not calculated (might change later)
